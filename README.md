Here is my portfolio which will display a little bit more about me. The template is found [here](https://html5up.net). This is under the CCA 3.0 license. You can visit my portfolio by going to this link [here](https://dj1ch.github.io/). If it wasn't known, this was written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SCSS. Most of the HTML and CSS is modified by me. I also created a script that sends messages along a discord webhook using(you guessed it) javascript. If you are going to use it replace my webhook with your own.
