                <h3>Here's a little bit more about me...</h3>
                <p>For further context, regarding how I got here, it started with me coding a lot as a kid. Super simple stuff whether it be <i>Scratch</i>, coding books, computer exposure, etc. I picked up programming at a fairly young age and this skill continued into my teenage life.</p>
                <p>Eventaully as I grew up I tended to gravitate towards computers in general, leading me to learning Cybersecurity. A mix of free online courses such as <a href="https://tryhackme.com">Tryhackme</a>, with some people in my family helping nourish my skill. I messed with Microcontrollers, SBC's, Chromebooks, etc (and I still do).</p>
                <p>Now, I spend most of my time studying for school, extracurriculars, or working on personal projects. I'm pretty busy now and I hope to make it into a good college.</p>
